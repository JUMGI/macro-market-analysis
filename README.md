# Quant Macro Research Lab

## Overview

This repository contains a quantitative research environment focused on macro-driven financial market analysis and systematic asset allocation.

The objective is to integrate multiple dimensions of market information into a unified research framework:

* Macroeconomic data

## Research Philosophy

Financial markets are driven not only by economic reality, but by expectations, liquidity regimes and investor positioning.

This project approaches markets as adaptive systems where macro conditions, sentiment and price behavior interact dynamically.

* reproducibility
* empirical validation
* systematic decision-making
